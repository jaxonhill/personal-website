                    I'm a computer science student with a passion for designing
                    and coding interactive applications. I always enjoy learning
                    new technologies and originally started my coding journey as a
                    self-taught programmer.

                    My current focus is designing and building for web development,
                    but in the coming years I'm looking forward to learning game
                    development and machine learning, in and outside of school.
